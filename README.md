# Simple Python Weather Application for Beginners with error handling

This is a simple weather application built with Python. It allows users to input a city name and fetch real-time weather data from the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The app features basic error handling and uses an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach, making it a great practice project for beginners.

### Features:
- Fetches weather data (location, temperature, and weather condition) based on the city input by the user.
- Includes error handling to manage network issues, invalid city names, and other unexpected situations.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to try again if something goes wrong.
- Implements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with `class`, `self`, `__init__()`, and `super()`.

## Installation

To run the weather application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-python-weather-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd simple-python-weather-app
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   This project uses the `requests` library to make API requests. You can install it using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Get an API Key:**

   To use this weather app, you need to obtain an API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). Once you sign up and get your API key, replace the `api_key` variable in the code with your own key.

2. **Run the Program:**

   After installing the dependencies and setting up the API key, run the application:

   ```bash
   python weather_app.py
   ```

3. **Enter the city name:**

   The app will ask you to enter a city name. Type the name of any city to fetch its current weather.

   Example:
   ```
   Enter your city name: London
   üìç London, United Kingdom
   üå°Ô∏è 15¬∞C ‚Äî Partly cloudy
   ```

4. **Error Handling:**

   If the city name is incorrect or there is a network issue, the program will print an error message and allow you to try again.

## Code Structure

The application is structured using Object-Oriented Programming principles, with the following key components:

- **`WeatherApp` Class:** The main class containing methods for initializing the app, making the API request, and handling the response.
  - **`__init__(self, api_key)`**: Initializes the application with the provided API key.
  - **`weather_get(self, city)`**: Fetches and displays weather data for the specified city. Handles exceptions such as invalid city names, network issues, and API response errors.
  - **`run(self)`**: Keeps prompting the user for a city name until valid weather data is returned.

## Example Output

```bash
Enter your city name: London
üìç London, United Kingdom
üå°Ô∏è 15¬∞C ‚Äî Partly cloudy
```

## Error Handling

This application includes the following error handling:

1. **Network Errors**: If the app encounters any issue during the API request (e.g., network failure), it will display an error message and retry the request.
   
2. **Invalid City Name**: If the city is not found in the WeatherAPI database, the app will inform the user and ask for another city name.

3. **Invalid API Response**: If the API returns an invalid or corrupted response, the app will handle it gracefully.
